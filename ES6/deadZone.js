/**
 * Var can be accessed before they're defined, but we ca't access their value
 * 'let' and 'const' cant be accessed before we define them
 * Var can be accessed before they're defined and hence the values becomes undefined
 * let lets the variable sit in a 'temporal dead zone' untill they are declared
 - This causes an error when accessed before initialization making it easier to debug code rather faster
